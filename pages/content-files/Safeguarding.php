<p align="justify">I developed this Magic Show alongside the Lancashire Constabulary and LANPAC [The Lancashire Partnership Against Crime].  It was initially funded and developed to support the Department for Children Schools and Families 'Learning to be Safe Together' toolkit.</p>

<p align="justify">Our objective is to provide simple and clear messages to Primary School children [Key Stage 2; 7 to 11 years] on the subject of "Community Safety and Cohesion" to <span class="style15">ensure personal safety measures are embedded</span> at an early age, in <span class="style15">under 50 minutes!</span></p>
<p align="justify">Lesson plans incorporate Friendships, Similarities and Differences, Personal Safety, Stranger Danger and Peer Pressure have also been developed to <span class="style15">perfectly complement my Magic Show</span>. These can be found <a href="http://wherestheline.co.uk/KS2safeguarding/" target="_blank">here</a>.  </p>

<p align="justify">The key message of '<em>We all protect each other</em>' is complemented by appropriate magical effects, and even the appearance of '<em>Buddy the Puppet</em>', are all designed to ensure the <span class="style15">children are kept engaged</span> and the <span class="style15">key messages are absorbed.</span></p>
<p align="justify">The show has now been performed in over 90 schools throughout Lancashire and has enjoyed very positive feedback.</p>
<p align="justify"><span class="style15"><strong>In short, this is a proven, novel and innovative method of introducing sensitive subjects at a level relevant to the audience.</strong></span></p>
